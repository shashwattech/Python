# âœ… Problem:
# Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

# ðŸ§  Approach:
# We use Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm, which runs in O(n) time.

# The idea is to accumulate a running sum (curSum), and if it drops below zero, we reset it.

# We track the maximum sum weâ€™ve seen so far using maxSub.

# ðŸš€ Logic Flow:
# Initialize curSum = 0 and maxSub = array[0].

# Loop through the array:

# If curSum drops below 0, reset it to 0 (because negative sums can't help future subarrays).

# Add current value to curSum.

# Update maxSub to the maximum of itself and curSum.
